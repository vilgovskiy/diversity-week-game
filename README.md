diversity-week-game
===
A small browser game I hacked together for Diversity week event back in 2017.  
Runs on vanilla HTML + CSS + JavaScript.  
Uses [Howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js) to play sounds.  

## The game
![DiversityWeekGame screenshot](https://github.com/vilgovskiy/diversity-week-game/blob/master/screenshot.JPG)  
When timer starts the countdown, you will hear a song. Your goal is to guess the language in which the song is sung.  
You have 1 minute or 21 guesses to get right as many languages as you can.

## Running the game
Download this repo  
Run npm install to download Howler.js  
And just run `gameForDiversityWeek.html` in your browser
